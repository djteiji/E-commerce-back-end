# E-commerce-back-end
Weekly Challenge #13

## Purpose

Build the back end for an e-commerce site. Take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017 (Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

- Application connects to database using Sequelize through an environment variable file when I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password.

- When schema and seed commands are entered, a development database is created and seeded with test data.

- When the command to invoke the application is entered (npm start), the server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database.

- When API GET routes are opened in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
then the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

- When API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes are tested in Insomnia, you can then create, update, and delete data in the database.
